## Trainer Class Project

This project is a simple JavaScript app that shows how to use classes, methods, and modules to organise code.

It includes:
- A Trainer class with properties like name, level, and energy
- Methods like train(), rest(), and describe() that update and return trainer info
- Use of the this keyword to refer to each trainer’s own data
- Code split into separate files using export and import for better structure

# Files
- trainer.js – contains the class and its methods
- main.js – creates trainer objects and calls their methods
- index.html – loads the JavaScript using <script type="module">
