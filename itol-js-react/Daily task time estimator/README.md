- Long (above 45 minutes)

Features:
- Users can enter a task name and estimated time in minutes
- Clicking the Add Task button adds the task to a categorised list below
- Each task is styled based on its time range: Quick, Moderate, or Long
- A total of all task times is displayed and updates with each new input
