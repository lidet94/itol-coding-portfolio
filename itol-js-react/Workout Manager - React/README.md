**Workout Planner**

This is a simple React application that helps users organise their exercises based on intensity levels.
Users can enter an exercise name, choose a type (Cardio, Strength, Flexibility), select one or more categories (Legs, Arms, Core, Full Body), and assign an intensity level.
Exercises are automatically sorted into Low, Medium, and High intensity columns for easy viewing and management.

 **Features**
- Inputs exercise detail
- Select multiple categories using toggle buttons
- Automatically sort exercises into intensity‑based columns
- Delete exercises from any column

**Future Improvements**
- Edit Exercise Button: Add an Edit button to each exercise card, allowing users to modify the exercise name, type, categories, or intensity directly from the column

- Save Changes Button: After editing, users can confirm updates with a Save button that writes the changes back into the main exercise list

- Improve the layout for mobile and tablet screens
