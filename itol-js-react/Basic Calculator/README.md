**Basic Calculator**

This is a small calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you do basic arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. I also added a Clear button to reset the inputs and the result display.

**Features:**
- Input two numbers
- Choose an operation: +, -, *, /
- Error handling for invalid numbers and division by zero
- Clear button to reset everything

**How it works:**
- When you click a button, it runs the calculator() function with the selected operation.
- It checks if both inputs are valid numbers.
- If they are, it performs the calculation and shows the result.
- If not, it shows an error message.
- The Clear button empties both input fields and the result area.

**Why I made this:**
Iâ€™m learning JavaScript and wanted to build something practical to test my understanding of functions, DOM manipulation, and basic UI. This helped me practice:
- Parsing input values
- Using switch statements
- Handling edge cases
- Updating the DOM with results

**Next steps**
I might improve this by:
- Adding keyboard support
- Styling the result area more clearly
- Making it responsive on smaller screens
