## MATH ASSIGNMENT

This contains two simple JavaScript scripts that demonstrate how to work with arrays, loops, user input, and math methods. One script calculates the average toxin level from river samples, and the other analyses task durations entered by the user.

Scripts are:

1. river_toxin_mean.js
Calculates the mean (average) of five decimal values representing toxin levels in river samples.
- Uses a for loop to sum values in an array
- Calculates the average and rounds it to two decimal places
- Logs a message with the final result

2. task_time_analyser.js
Prompts the user to enter three task durations (minutes), then calculates the average, shortest, and longest task.
- Uses prompt() to collect input
- Converts input to numbers with parseFloat()
- Uses Math.min() and Math.max()
- Rounds the average and logs a summary message
