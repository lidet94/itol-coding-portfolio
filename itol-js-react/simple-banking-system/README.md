## Simple Banking System

This project shows how to use classes, methods, and modules to organise code. A banking system where users can manage their accounts.

It includes:
- The use of classes
- Defining and using methods: deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance()
- Using the this keyword to access object properties
- Splitting code into modules using export and import
- Running JavaScript modules in the browser with <script type="module">

# Files
bankAccount.js: - defines the BankAccount class and its methods
- index.js – creates account instances and performs actions
- index.html – loads the JavaScript and connects everything in the browser

# How to Run
Open index.html using Live Server in VS Code.
Modules won’t work with direct file paths (file://) due to browser security rules.
