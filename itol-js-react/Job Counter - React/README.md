# Job Counter

This project is a simple React component that demonstrates how to use the useState hook.  

It allows users to:
- Add jobs (increment the counter)
- Remove jobs (decrement the counter, without going below zero)
- Reset the job count to zero

## Features
- Job Counter Display: Shows the current number of jobs.
- Add Job: Increases the job count by 1.
- Remove Job: Decreases the job count by 1 (but never below 0).
- Reset Job: Resets the job count back to 0.
- Console Logging: Each action logs the updated count to the console.

The project was built as part of a practical activity to practice state management and conditional rendering in React.
