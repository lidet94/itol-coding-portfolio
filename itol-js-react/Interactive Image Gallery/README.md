**Interactive Image Gallery**

A web app that allows users to add and remove images from a gallery. 

What I Learned:
- How to dynamically create and remove DOM elements using createElement() and removeChild()
- How to use addEventListener() to respond to user actions
- How to structure HTML and CSS for flexible, interactive layouts
- How to validate user input and clear fields after submission
- How to group related elements (image + button) for clean removal and styling

Features:
- Add images by entering a valid image URL
- Remove any image with a single click
- Input field clears automatically after submission

Future Improvements:
- Validate image URLs
