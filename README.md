# ITOL Coding Portfolio 

Welcome! This portfolio documents my journey through the ITOL coding programme as I transition into tech. I'm an aspiring software developer gaining hands-on experience through structured learning and mini projects.

## Level 1: HTML & CSS Projects

Focused on building static websites using semantic HTML and CSS techniques. I completed hands-on projects that taught me how to structure web pages, style layouts, and build responsive designs using both custom CSS and frameworks like Tailwind.

## Level 2: JavaScript & React Projects

Projects focused on interactivity, DOM manipulation, and component-based development using Javascript and React.
